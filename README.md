We believe that each of you have faced the same problem as I have. Imagine a typical doctor's appointment, analyzing test results and answering a series of questions: "When was your last blood pressure lab test? What was the latest blood sugar level? Do you have lab test results from a month ago? And from a year ago? Or two years ago, perhaps?"
You come with a stack of papers and start searching. You keep thinking "Maybe it was in a folder? Or on a piece of paper flying somewhere around the house? Was the test taken at medical clinic A or maybe B?" 
Imagine a perfect situation - that you keep all the results in one place - saving your and the doctor's time! And here we're with the solution to all above problems - our app "Go For Your Health!". It's very easy, just take a picture of your test results, and the app will analyze your results and visualize them in charts. Thanks to that, you can compare test results from the past with the current ones. The user will be informed of any anomalies and the need for a follow-up visit or additional tests. Everything can be seen in one place. The basic version of the app allows to enter data manually, while the premium paid version allows to scan data automatically by using your phone camera. Don't wait! Appreciate your time, take care of your health, and use our app today!
